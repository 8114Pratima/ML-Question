1. What is the difference between stemming and lemmatization?

Stemming and lemmatization are both techniques used in natural language processing to reduce words to their base form. The main difference between the two is that stemming is a crude heuristic process that chops off the ends of words, while lemmatization is a more sophisticated process that uses vocabulary and morphological analysis to determine the base form of a word. Lemmatization is more accurate but also more computationally expensive.

Example: The word "better"

Stemming: The stem of the word "better" is likely to be "better" (e.g. by using Porter stemmer)
Lemmatization: The base form of the word "better" is "good" (e.g. by using WordNetLemmatizer with POS tagger)
